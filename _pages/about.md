Email: rantao16 [at] umd [dot] edu

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu/). Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Yu Gu](https://www.math.umd.edu/~ygu7/). Previously, I got my B.S. degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Fudan University in 2019.

My research is in Probability and Stochastic analysis. I am interested in the random dynamics in stochastic partial differential equations. Currently, I am working with some stochastic heat equations and KPZ equations. 

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
